The synthetic indicators are produced by the spatial micro-simulation model (SpatialMSM). The data has been provided by The National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (NATSEM).<br/><br/>\n\nNATSEM???s spatial microsimulation model uses a technique that takes a survey and reweights it to small area Census data. SpatialMSM18 is the application of the NATSEM Spatial Microsimulation model using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) dataset, the ABS Housing Expenditure Survey (for financial stress) and the 2016 Census of Population and Housing at the SA2 level (Tanton et al. 2011). All the indicators from the SpatialMSM model are synthetic, so there is some model error as well as other error from the survey. Therefore, they are not as accurate as the Census data used.<br/><br/>\n\nData in this dataset comes from NATSEM's spatial microsimulation model. Estimates are for subjective life satisfaction based on questions in the HILDA dataset. A full description of the model, and validation, can be found in the accompanying <a href=\"https://apps.aurin.org.au/gate/technicalreports/NATSEM/AURIN%20Trust%20Wellbeing%20Financial%20Stress%20Technical%20Report%20Nov%202018.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">NATSEM Technical Report</a>.<br/><br/>\n\nPlease note: \n<ul>\n<li>AURIN has spatially enabled the original data provided directly from NATSEM.</li>\n<li>Where data values are NULL, the data is either unpublished or not applicable mathematically.</li>\n<li>The treatment of Not Stated and Overseas Visitor data is to exclude them from both the numerator and the denominator.</li>\n</ul>\n","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa2_code16","type":"String","title":"SA2 Code","description":"SA2 Code.","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa2_name16","type":"String","title":"SA2 Name","description":"SA2 Name.","isDimension":false},{"name":"total_pop_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people (estimated by the modelling)","description":"Number of people (estimated by the modelling)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_0_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 0 (PLOSAT=0)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 0 (PLOSAT=0)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_10_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 10 (PLOSAT=1)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 10 (PLOSAT=1)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_20_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 20 (PLOSAT=2)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 20 (PLOSAT=2)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_30_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 30 (PLOSAT=3)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 30 (PLOSAT=3)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_40_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 40 (PLOSAT=4)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 40 (PLOSAT=4)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_50_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 50 (PLOSAT=5)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 50 (PLOSAT=5)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_60_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 60 (PLOSAT=6)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 60 (PLOSAT=6)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_70_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 70 (PLOSAT=7)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 70 (PLOSAT=7)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_80_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 80 (PLOSAT=8)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 80 (PLOSAT=8)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_90_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 90 (PLOSAT=9)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 90 (PLOSAT=9)","isDimension":false},{"name":"_life_satisfaction_100_synth","type":"Integer","title":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 100 (PLOSAT=10)","description":"Number of people with life satisfaction at 100 (PLOSAT=10)","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa2_code16","geoLevel":"sa2_2016","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[144.33363404800002,-38.50298801599996,145.8784120140001,-37.17509899299995],"featureType":"gccsa_2016","featureInstance":"2GMEL","featureName":"Greater Melbourne","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
