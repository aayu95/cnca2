Such estimates are derived from the application of microsimulation modeling techniques to microdata based on sample surveys and the Commonwealth Census. These estimates may be different from the actual characteristics of the population because of sampling and non-sampling errors in the microdata and because of the assumptions underlying the modeling techniques.

This is an outcome of a process that combines substantial geographic information from the latest 2011 Census with the rich variable detail of National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey (NATSISS) 2008. The model uses both these sets of data to gain reliable small area estimates of Indigenous social indicator. The indicators include participation in cultural activities; social capital; discrimination; health status; psychological stress; social and emotional wellbeing; financial stress; feelings of safety or stress; identification with clan, tribal or language group.","selectedAttributes":[{"name":"sa2_main11","type":"Integer","title":"SA2 ID","description":"Unique ID of SA2, 9 digit","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"sa2_names","type":"String","title":"SA2 Name","description":"Name of the SA2","stype":"nominal","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_of_p_aged_15plus_deg_dip_and_cerificate","type":"Integer","title":"Degree, diploma or certificate (number), census data","description":"Number of Indigenous people aged 15 + who have degree, diploma or certificate, 2011 based on census data","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_of_p_aged_15plus_in_hi_kessler_synt_est","type":"Integer","title":"High psychological stress (number), synthetic estimate","description":"Number of Indigenous people aged 15 + with high psychological stress according to Kessler index, 2011 based on spatial microsimulation estimate","isDimension":false},{"name":"num_of_p_aged_15plus_in_poor_hlth_synt_est","type":"Integer","title":"Poor health (number), synthetic estimate","description":"Number of Indigenous people aged 15 + who are in poor health condition, 2011 based on spatial microsimulation estimate","isDimension":false},{"name":"pos_soc_and_emo_welb_avg_in_aged_15plus_synt_est","type":"Double","title":"Social and emotional wellbeing (mean), synthetic estimate","description":"The mean of positive social and emotional wellbeing of Indigenous people aged 15 + (from -1 to 1) , 2011 based on spatial microsimulation estimate","isDimension":false}],"filter":{"filterType":"tabular","feature":{"key":"sa2_main11","geoLevel":"sa2","geoField":"ignored","year":"2006","featureBbox":[144.33363404800002,-38.50298801599996,145.8784120140001,-37.17509899299995],"featureType":"gccsa_2016","featureInstance":"2GMEL","featureName":"Greater Melbourne","referenceSystemIdentifier":"urn:x-ogc:def:crs:EPSG:4283","prefix":"","keyTransform":null},"states":["2"]}}
